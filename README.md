# WineSelect

## Problem

Wine is enjoyed by an estimated 300 million to 1 billion people worldwide, but how many can confidently select a good wine when faced with a variety of bottles? Perhaps only 10% can navigate this challenge effectively.

### Consider These Scenarios:

- **Supermarket Dilemma:**  
  Picture yourself at the supermarket, standing in front of shelves lined with over 10 different wine bottles. Sure, you could research each one for reviews, ratings, and prices. But after a while, the information overload and the time-consuming process make it hard to decide.

- **The "Wine Expert" Friend:**  
  You‚Äôre hosting a party, and your wine-savvy friend is bound to critique your selection. You could research every bottle you have at home or send the details to them for approval, but who has the time?

Clearly, selecting the perfect wine can be stressful and time-consuming.

The network blocks some content due to its association with wine, which can limit app functionality.

‚ö° **Performance Notice:**  
Our back-end infrastructure is not fully optimized at the moment due to time constraints of the hackathon. It runs **2x faster** in a local environment.
